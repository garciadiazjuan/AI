# AI
This repository is a collection of my projects in Artificial intelligence. This includes projects using knowledge and logic to solve problems, projects that process natural language and solve search and optimisation problems. It also includes projects using machine learning models to improve at games or predict certain behaviour as well as neural networks to detect traffic. The following section includes an overview of the projects contained in this repository.

## Project Overview
### Knowledge
Knights Game
-   A simple propositional logic problem, based on the book made by logician Raymond Smullyan in 1978, titled “What is the name of this book?”
-   The problem works as follows, the reader is expected to determine using logic which character included in a short statement is a knight and which character is a knave.
    -   Knights always tell the truth
    -   Knaves always lie

Minesweeper
-    A simple propositional logic AI, that attempts to solve minesweeper using a knowledge base

### Language
Parser
-   A simple Natural Language Processing Project which aims to detect noun phrases in sentences.

Questions
-   This is a simple Natural Language Processing project which answers simple queries from a small knowledge base

### Learning
Nim Game
- A simple Machine Learning Model that plays the game nim and improves with every game

Shopping
-   A simple Machine Learning Model that aims to predict if a customer made an online purchase based on collected data

### Neural Networks
Traffic Detection
-   This is a tensorflow-based image proccessing application that uses neural networks to detect traffic

### Optimization
Crossword
-   This is an optimization AI capable of solving crosswords

### Search Problems
Degrees
-   This is a Search AI that, trained with a csv, can find a path connecting two nodes, in this case, it connects actors in Hollywood by movies they have starred in.

TicTacToe
-   This is a Search AI that, uses a minimax function to always make the best move in tictactoe.
